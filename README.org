#+TITLE: Gearman Worker Manager

* Synopsis

python-gearman-manager -w ./workers -d

Provides a fairly thin wrapper around gmtasks to daemonize a set of gearman
workers.

* Workers

Workers should be placed one worker per file in the workers directory
(see --worker-dir argument).  Files should be named for the gearman
job they handle.

Worker files should define a function doTask(worker, job, logger).  The only
difference from a gmtasks Task callback is the addition of the logger argument,
which is a logger adapter which adds information about the specific job (the
unique job string) to the logging output.

** Example Worker: reverse_string.py
#+begin_src python
  def doTask(worker, job, log):
      log.debug("going to reverse "+job.data)
      return job.data[::-1]
#+end_src

* Requirements

 * python-daemon
 * gmtasks
 * pidfile
